# Inspirational-Images-Bot
## A discord bot that allows users to upload images to google drive by tagging images they upload or mention.

### What it does:
When an user uploads an image, they can upload it to drive by typing "!tag <tag>" when uploading, or they can mention an image sent by someone else, with the same text, the bot will detect if the message has images, and upload them to the desired drive folder.

Discord server owners can modify the code by changing which tags to use, the ID of each drive folder, and the file formatting, but they also must configure their authentication for discord and google drive.
